# My Awesome Activities

Welcome to My Awesome Activities, your go-to website for discovering a curated list of exciting activities that guarantee to add a spark to your life! Whether you're looking for a thrilling outdoor adventure, a relaxing day indoors, or anything in between, we've got you covered.

# Get Started

To access the website and start exploring the exciting activities, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip.

```bash
pip install dependency
```

4. Run the Flask application.

```bash
python app.py
```

5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the website.

Note: The URL http://localhost:5000 assumes that the Flask app is running on the default port 5000. If you have configured the app to use a different port, replace 5000 with the appropriate port number in the URL.

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up the project, run the Flask app, and access the website locally on your machine. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed before running the application.

# Dependencies

Flask: A micro web framework for Python.
Flask-Behind-Proxy: A library for working with Flask applications behind a proxy.
Flask-SQLAlchemy: An extension for Flask that integrates SQLAlchemy for database interaction.
requests: A library for making HTTP requests to external APIs or web services.
json: A library for handling JSON data.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
